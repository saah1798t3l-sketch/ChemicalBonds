# Chemical Bonds

## Overview
This game is designed to reinforce the concept of Ionic versus Covalent bonds through an
    RPG style game. Kids can play this as a (hopefully) fun way to (hopefully) review the
    difference between the two.

## Covalent and Ionic???
These are the two major types of bonds. Covalent involves sharing of electrons while ionic
    involves "donation" of electrons.
## Notes
* The tiles suck- I'm not good at pixel art
## Credits:
* The artwork is all by me (in case you couldn't tell by the terrible quality...)
* The code is mostly based off of RyiSnow's 2d game tutorial
* Parts of code that control things specific to this game are by me
* No libraries needed, just Java
